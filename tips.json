Visit Lucan Brattleby, leader of the Crossed Wands Dueling Club, if you want to practice casting spells on a dummy. Spells Have Cooldown Periods Casting spells is the bread and butter of any formidable witch or wizard, but in Hogwarts Legacy, this comes at a cost. Once you cast a spell, it will enter a cooldown phase in which you cannot use it again for a short period of time. You can tell a spell is on cooldown by looking in the bottom right corner of the screen - if the spell's icon is filling up, it's still on cooldown and out of commission momentarily. Learn how long each spell takes to finish cooling down so you can pace yourself in combat. The length of the cooldown varies from spell to spell - the more powerful the spell, the longer the cooldown. Make sure you aren't relying solely on one spell so you don't get stuck in cooldown! You might even try brewing some Focus Potions in advance to shorten the cooldown period of your best spells.",
