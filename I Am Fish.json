This will affect your final scoring but allow you to proceed should a puzzle be too challenging.\n\nAfter you have played through all Goldfish levels you will be able to play all the other fish. You don’t have to play them sequentially. You’re free to explore them however you want!\n\nNot all breadcrumbs can be collected in one go. Multiple paths lead back to the ocean.
