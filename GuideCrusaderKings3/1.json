        "text": "Screen\tThe combined Screen of an army reduces the number of casualties after a lost battle. So more shielding for troops helps to preserve your defeated troops.\nLevies\tAn army consists of a majority of mostly poorly armed fighters, which become dangerous primarily due to their mass. Each holding generates a certain number of levies, i.e. fighters, for the respective ruler.\nLevy Reinforcement Rate\tTells you how quickly troops that have fallen in war can be regenerated so that you can send them back into battle.\nHolding\tA holding is the central settlement of a barony or county and may comprise a castle, city or temple as its main building. Depending on the type of holding, the title holder receives taxes and levies.\nDevelopment\tDevelopment raises the technological progress and the local infrastructure of a county, which has a positive effect on the amount of taxes and levies as well as the supply limit.\nHostile Raid Time\tExtends the duration of a raid performed by enemy armies that loot and pillage a county, thus making it easier for the native defenders to gather forces with which they can intercept looters.\nFort Level\tFortified holdings have a Fort level that determines how long a siege of this holding by an attacking army lasts. The higher the Fort Level, the longer the siege is likely to last. High Fort Levels also require the use of siege weapons for an effective siege.\nPiety\tThis value indicates how virtuous a character acts in the context of his faith. Monasteries contribute to the piety value of the Liege.\nGarrison\tThe garrison of a holding defends it during sieges performed by smaller armies. Since the besieging army must have more troops than the stationed garrison, a large garrison is an advantage for the defender.\nCounty\tDescribes a county (which is usually consisting of several holdings). The county capital is the main holding of a county and is always owned by the ruler who holds the title of the county.\nControl\tDescribes how well the government is in control of the population of a county. The higher the control, the higher the taxes and levies received from the county. Control is reduced by sieges, peasant uprisings and exchange of the title holder.\nOpinion\tIncrease the opinion value of the designated population group (for example vassals, clergy, population, etc.) about your ruler character by a certain amount.\nPrestige\tPrestige refers equally to the renown and social status of a character. Magnificent buildings increase the prestige of the liege on whose soil they were built.\nKnights\tKnights serve as champions in your ruler’s army and cause additional damage in battle through their power. The more knights your ruler is allowed to have, the higher the generated effect.\nKnight Effectiveness\tAt 100 percent effectiveness, your knights fight in accordance with their values whereas at 200 percent, their damage potential increases as much as if their Prowess skill values were doubled.\nDamage\tThis effect increases the damage value of the designated unit (for example skirmishers) by a certain amount.\nTax/Gold\tEach holding generates a certain amount of gold, which you as the ruler receive either directly because you are the liege of the holding, or you receive a portion of the income, which is passed on to you by one of your vassals.\nSupply Limit\tSpecifies the maximum number of troops that can be stationed in a county. If the sum of your own and the enemy’s troops exceeds the supply limit, the armies lose the supply they brought with them and suffer a penalty on their advantage in battle. If all supplies are used up, an army is worn down and loses troops through desertion, disease or hunger.\nPursuit\tThis effect increases the number of losses a victorious army causes to the fleeing enemy after the battle (by combining the pursuit value of all troops).\nAdvantage\tThe (combat) advantage determines that one side causes more damage in battle than the other side and is made up of modifiers such as terrain, martial skill value as well as the commander traits of the army commander. Defender advantages are automatically applied to the defending army at the start of a battle.\nToughness\tThis effect increases the toughness (and thus the amount of damage a soldier can take in battle before it counts as a loss) of the designated unit (for example archer) by a certain amount.",

        "text": "Swap Wife (and/or Concubine)\nA male ruler with a woman in her mid-30s to early 40s has a very low chance of having children, as women become infertile at this age. If you have not produced an heir by then, a divorce including marriage to a young, fertile woman is highly recommended. If this is not easy to accomplish, our divorce tips in the section on Marriage and Divorce will help you. The same applies to concubines, if the faith of your ruler allows concubinage – if it doesn’t work out with the offspring, new partners must be sought.\nProtect heirs from death in war\nGenerally forbid your heirs to serve as champions, because lost battles are more likely to have a negative effect on the health of your elite fighters. The game automatically selects characters with high warfare and martial skill stats as champions, which means you should check the champion list (in the military window, F3) regularly. Use the “Forbid” option to keep potential heirs away from lethal battles.\nImprove spouse’s opinion\nIf a couple doesn’t get along well, it won’t work out between the sheets either. Increases the opinion of the spouse or wife by an Sway Scheme or uses a Romance Scheme, provided that the personality traits of the couple are compatible enough (if the traits do not match, the chance of success of a Romance Scheme drops to zero). As an alternative, you can make your wife or unwilling husband your lover by using a Seduce Scheme. Casual fun still bears the chance of successful impregnation after all.\nIncrease fertility of the ruler\nSometimes it takes a little push to turn rulers into happy parents. With the perks “Matriarch/Patriarch” (Diplomacy/Family Hierarch) and “Whole of Body” (Learning/Whole of Body) and “Seducer” (Intrigue/Seducer) you will get a noticeable bonus of 20 percent due to the characteristics associated with them. The perk “Like Weeds in a Garden” (Intrigue/Seducer) increases the fertility of your character even by a full 30 percent! Once your dynasty has gained enough popularity, you can unlock the “Bounteous Loins” legacy in the “Kin” category, which increases the fertility of all characters in the dynasty by ten percent.\nBreed and legitimize Bastards\nCheck the faith doctrines to see how your ruler’s faith views bastards. If children of the ruler are automatically legitimized by the doctrine “No Bastards”, seek an affair and by events to engage in frequent sexual escapades – at some point a shot will hopefully be a goal. If the doctrine “Legitimization” rules, it’s best to devote yourself to several affairs and get on good terms with the Head of Faith of your religion (or the Dynasty Head, if there is no Head of Faith), to ensure that the bastard is legitimized after birth. Only if the faith of the ruler does not legitimize bastards, this method will not work. In this case, the Intrigue Lifestyle “Seducer” also helps, because many perks boost the strength and chance of success of seduce schemes.\nRecruit a competent Court Physician\nFor smaller and larger aches and pains, an averagely trained court physician is more than sufficient. However, when it comes to really unpleasant diseases, the experimental treatment performed by an outstanding court physician can mean the difference between life and death for your heirs. Don’t be satisfied with leisure-time physicians when it comes to health!\nFemale Ruler\nIf you are playing a female ruler, you must keep the succession in mind as early as your fertile age. If you are in your early or mid-twenties, make sure you arrange a matrilineal marriage (children are born in the mother’s house), so that children born in the early twenties and mid-twenties are born in the mother’s succession. Never choose a husband with the quality “Chaste” or physical characteristics that reduce fertility. Increase the opinion of the spouse by using sway or romance schemes to make the couple become familiar with each other as soon as possible.\n",

        "text": "Send redundant heirs as champions to war\nIf there are too many male heirs, you will sort out the unwanted sons, brothers or uncles most easily by “forcing” them to serve as Champions. Open the Military window (F3) and the Champion overview to use the “Force” option on these heirs and conscript them into military service. Then send your Champions out in a weak army (don’t forget to split the army!) that is lead by an incompetent Commander to fight against strong enemies or to loot neighbouring realms – the rest will be done by the dangerous battle life as soon as they meet the enemy.\nUsing your role as the Dynasty Head to disinherit heirs: If you are the head of your dynasty, you can easily get rid of annoying and redundant heirs by simply disinheriting them. Right-click on the character image of the heir you want to get rid of, click on “Hostile” and then select “Disinherit”. It couldn’t be easier!\nCreate a higher Primary Title\nEspecially in the case of forms of inheritance law such as Confederate Partition and Partition, a realm quickly falls apart into many parts if your deceased ruler held too many titles of equal rank. Try to expand your realm early enough to gather all parts of a De Jure Duchy so that you can recreate a corresponding title. Since your main heir always receives the highest title, you will avoid the fragmentation of your realm that way.\nSearch for secrets of your heirs\nLet your Spymaster perform the councillor task of “Find Secrets” at your court. With a bit of luck he will find a secret of an heir that will be considered a crime. You can throw a criminal courtier into your dungeon without having to fear any consequences – and depending on the conditions of imprisonment, such a thing is quite unhealthy. If you don’t find anything suitable or your heirs are leading a virtuous life, you can use the perk “Kidnapper” (Intrigue/Schemer) to unlock the option of abduction schemes and then attempt to get the respective heir into your control (and your dungeon) by abducting him.\nForging a murder scheme\nWhen nothing else helps, there is still the possibility to get rid of unwanted heirs through murder schemes. You have a good chance of not being discovered, as long as your intrigue value is high enough and you are able to find competent helpers.\n",

        "text": "Particularly in freshly conquered areas or counties that do not follow the faith or culture of your ruler character, the people begin to boil rather quickly. The lower the popular opinion of your ruler, the greater the probability of peasant uprisings, in which you then have to defend yourself against your own people. Even dissatisfied vassals tend to stab you in the back in times where you are weakened. That’s why our Crusader Kings 3 tips in this section are dedicated to the question of how you can make both your people and your vassals happy, or more precisely: how to increase their opinion of your ruler and clear out possible sources of unrest.\n\n   If a vassal leads a faction against you, he is your most important target when trying to improve opinions: a faction loses a lot of influence once the leader leaves it.\n  ",

        "text": "Align culture: If you rule over peasants and citizens from another culture, there will naturally be a lot of friction. Send your Steward with the task “Promote Culture” to counties that do not belong to the culture of your ruler. The map option “Cultures” (lower row of cards in the middle, with the “Book” symbol) will tell you where the culture of the ruler differs from the culture of the people by marking those areas in stripes. The higher the stewardship value of your Steward, the faster this councillor task will be completed.\nAlign faith: If your ruler and his people adhere to different faiths, there are, depending on the relationship of the faiths to each other, sometimes enormous deductions in Opinion. Only forced conversion can help here! Either you allow your ruler to convert to the prevailing faith, or you convert the citizens to the faith of your ruler. You convert your ruler through a corresponding decision, which costs you a certain amount of Piety. With the councilor task “Convert Faith in County” given to your Court Chaplain/Realm Priest, you bring the people to the desired denominational line. The higher the Learning value of your Court Chaplain/Realm Priest, the faster this will be done.\nIs strengthened by the perk “Zealous Proselytizer” (Learning/Theologian). The “Religious Icon” (Learning/Theologian) perk also negates the temporal limit that arises in the conversion of counties whose faith has a higher fervor value than the ruler’s faith.\nPerk “Popular Figurehead” (Stewardship/Architect): You can raise the popular opinion by as much as +50 with this perk. If your ruler follows the Stewardship Lifestyle, this perk becomes especially worthwhile if you plan to conquer large territories or try to gain a foothold in a troubled realm.\nPerk “Open-Minded” (Learning/Scholar): The opinion of members of other cultures about your ruler increases by +15, and apart from that there is no negative effect for you caused by foreign cultures of others.\nCarefully choose Event Decisions: From time to time you will be given decisions, of which the results may also affect popular opinion. Unless the other options provide a clear, useful effect, always choose the options that will increase public opinion when dealing with problems involving the population.\n",

        "text": "Sway or Befriend scheme : The basic method, available from the start of the game, is an “sway” scheme against a disliked vassal. This counts as personal scheme and offers you decision-making moments at certain intervals, in which the opinion of the scheme’s target about your character can improve. There are also possible events whose successful outcome earns you an additional opinion bonus. If you have activated the perk “Befriend” (Diplomacy/Family Hierarch), you can bind an already pacified vassal closer to your ruler character through friendship.\nConvert vassals: If a vassal belongs to a different faith than your ruler, this will give little to significant opinion deductions, depending on the relationship between the faiths. With the religion option “Demand Conversion” in the character menu of the vassal, you insistently urge the vassal to convert to the ruler’s faith.\nAppointing a vassal to a council post: Powerful vassals are especially keen on having an influential position. If possible, provide powerful (and competent!) vassals with the desired position in order to ensure that they act in your interest in the future. However, if the vassals’ skill values are low, you should keep them out of the Council, or else they will provoke negative events, based on the chosen councillor task!\nHold a Feast: Use the decision “Hold Feast” in the decision window regularly, if you have enough gold in reserve. If everything goes smoothly, you will increase the opinion values of one of the participants per feast. However, embarrassing events can also occur, which you can counter only with stress. Feasts are therefore only a safe bet for characters with the personality trait “Sociable”, as they automatically lose stress once the feast is over.\nSelect suitable perks: The “Lovable” (Stewardship/Administrator) perk increases the opinion of direct vassals by 10, the “Positions of Power” (Stewardship/Administrator) perk increases the opinion of council members towards your ruler by an additional 20. The “Toe the Line” (Stewardship/Administrator) perk makes your vassals less likely to join Independence factions. The Administrator trait, which your character gets through the same-named perk (Stewardship/Administrator), increases the vassal opinion by 5.\nUnite De Jure Duchies: If you have dukes or kings under your reign who lack counties that belong to their titles, this will be clearly reflected in their opinions. Use the “Duchies” overview of the map (top row, far left icon) to find out which counties belong to which title, or click on a duchy’s coat of arms on the map to display all vassals belonging to it. Unite the counties belonging to the vassal title by assigning them to that vassal. This also applies to kingdoms if you are an emperor.\nPerform the councillor task “Domestic Affairs”: Let your Chancellor perform the councillor task ” Domestic Affairs” to improve long-term relations with all vassals. The bonus is lower than in a sway scheme, but its effects are more widespread.\nThe efficiency of the councillor task is increased by the perk “Chains of Loyalty” (Stewardship/Administrator).\nGet rid of the unlawful ruler penalty: If you have conquered lands that lie far outside your ancestral realm (for example, as Emperor of Byzantium lands in Africa), the vassals there will be dissatisfied because they don’t like foreign rule. Create, if not already existing, a duke or king title of these more distant lands and give it to a local vassal. If you already have a higher-ranking vassal in the disputed territory, put the dissatisfied vassals under his control.\nScare vassals into fear and terror: If friendship does not work, then tyranny will! Use options such as torturing prisoners or horrifying event decisions to increase your ruler’s terror value. Especially useful for this are the perks from the Intrigue Lifestyle “Torturers”. Once a character has reached a certain level of terror (Different from character to character), vassals become so afraid of your ruler that they no longer dare to rebel against him. The reign of terror becomes problematic, however, when your ruler himself becomes a prisoner of war or falls ill: If his terror decreases, the fear of the vassals also decreases. And that will come back to you when the vassals’ opinions towards your ruler fall through the cracks…\n",
